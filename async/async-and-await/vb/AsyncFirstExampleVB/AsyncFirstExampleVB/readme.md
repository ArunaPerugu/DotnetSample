# Introduction

This sample is a WPF application that contains the example method from Asynchronous Progamming with Async and Await in Visual Basic. The topic gives an overview of asynchronous programming, including when to use it and how you write an Async method. This sample contains the Async Function that is used as an illustration.

Async and Await provide all the advantages of traditional asynchronous programming, but with much less effort from the developer. The compiler does the difficult work that the developer used to do, yet the code retains a logical structure that resembles synchronous code.

The example Async Function in this sample (named GetStringAsync) uses an HttpClient method to download the contents of a website.

The code for the MainWindow.xaml.vb or MainWindow.xaml.cs file from this sample is included in the topic.

## Building the Sample

To download and run the sample, follow these steps:

 1. Download and unzip the sample.
    
 2. In Visual Studio (2019 or later), on the menu bar, choose File, Open, Project/Solution.
 
 3. Navigate to the folder that holds the unzipped sample code, and open the solution (.sln) file.
 
 4. Choose the F5 key, or Ctrl+F5 keys, to run the project.
