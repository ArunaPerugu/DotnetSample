# MSIX Windows Forms Core Application

This sample shows how to use the Windows Packaging Project to package a WinForms application running on Core.

## Pre-requisites

To use the Windows Packaging Project (wapproj) you need to install the Universal Windows workload in Visual Studio.

To produce `MSIX` packages you must have the **Windows 10 Octobe 2018 SDK** (aka 10.0.17763), otherwise the generated package will have the `APPX` extension.
